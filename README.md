### 👋 About Me

Hi there! I’m **Bouchra**, a junior software engineer passionate about creating seamless, elegant, and user-centered digital experiences. I blend my technical background with a love for design to craft interfaces that don't just work — they *feel right*.

I enjoy:
- 🧠 Thinking in systems and pixels
- 🎨 Turning ideas into interactive experiences
- 🚀 Learning and leveling up daily

Currently exploring:
- Front-end magic with **Vue.js** and **Bootstrap**
- Back-end logic with **Laravel** and **Spring**
- Clean UI/UX patterns & micro-interactions

### 🧩 Fun Fact

I love designing interfaces as much as coding them — turning wireframes into beautiful, interactive realities is my happy place. 🎧💡
