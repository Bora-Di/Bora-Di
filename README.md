### 🧭 Who I Am

I’m a junior software engineer with a growing passion for **Java & Spring**, currently sharpening my skills in the **Laravel/PHP ecosystem** through real-world projects.

With a background rooted in both **development** and **interface design**, I work at the intersection of code and creativity — transforming concepts into user-focused, scalable digital products.

I care about:
- **Clean front-end architecture** with frameworks like React & Tailwind
- **User experience design** that’s accessible, aesthetic, and functional
- **Back-end logic** and modular systems with Spring Boot or Laravel
- Bridging the gap between **design tools** (like Figma) and **production-ready code**
