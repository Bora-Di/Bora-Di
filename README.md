### 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm a **junior software engineer** recently graduated from **ENSAH**, currently working as a **front-end engineer** with Laravel and PHP — while actively building strong skills in **Java** and the **Spring ecosystem**, where my real interest lies.

My work blends development and design. I love creating **functional, clean, and intuitive user interfaces**, and translating ideas into engaging digital experiences — whether through code or design.

What I focus on:
- **Frontend development** (React, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap)
- **UI/UX design** (Figma, component systems, responsive design)
- **Backend fundamentals** (Laravel, Java, Spring Boot)
- **Design-to-code workflows** (prototypes to production)

### 💡 Mindset

- I care about **clean architecture**, **pixel-perfect interfaces**, and **user-first design**.
- I'm comfortable collaborating with designers and developers alike — I speak both languages.
- I'm investing in learning **Spring Boot** and **Java fullstack** development, aiming to build robust back-end systems.
